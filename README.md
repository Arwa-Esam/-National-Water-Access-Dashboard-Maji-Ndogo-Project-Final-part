# 📊 Maji Ndogo Water – Public Dashboard Overview

This dashboard was developed as part of the **Maji Ndogo Water Source Improvement Project**, following a request to create a public-facing report that clearly communicates how funds are being used, the impact of improvements, and the overall project progress.  
It is designed for **citizens, partners, and project decision-makers** to monitor progress in real time.

---

## 🌍 Dashboard Purpose

The public dashboard provides transparent insights into:

- Overall project progress  
- Total expenditure to date  
- Spending breakdown by province  
- What the funds were used for  
- Budget forecast and whether it is sufficient  
- Potential areas for cost optimization  
- Data representation at national, provincial, and town levels  
- Ground-level insight into improvement activities

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Public Water Dashboard

### ✅ 1. National Water Access Is Still Low
Only **47.8%** of the population currently has access to basic water services.  
This means **over half of Maji Ndogo** still struggles with safe, consistent water access, highlighting a major need for continued investment.

---

### ✅ 2. 4 Million People Recently Gained Water Access
The project has already enabled **4 million individuals** to obtain basic water access.  
This confirms that the interventions are having a meaningful and measurable impact.

---

### ✅ 3. Budget Spending Is Slightly Above Target
Total spending has reached **$33.8M**, which is **10.69% higher** than the planned budget.  
This signals potential **cost overruns** and the need for more careful monitoring as the project continues.

---

### ✅ 4. Overall Project Completion Is Still Low
The project is currently **22% complete**, despite significant spending.  
This mismatch between **spending vs. completion** suggests:
- Work is progressing slowly
- Some areas might require operational adjustments
- Potential bottlenecks in field execution

---

### ✅ 5. Most Money Is Concentrated in 2 Provinces
A large portion of the budget is going to:
- **Sokoto (~$11.1M)**
- **Kilimani (~$6.66M)**

These provinces are consuming the majority of funds, likely due to:
- High infrastructure needs
- Larger population sizes
- More improvement activities

---

### ✅ 6. RO Filter Installations Are the Highest-Cost Activity
The single most expensive improvement category is:
- **Install RO Filter – $14M**

This indicates:
- High demand for clean water treatment
- RO filters being the preferred method for long-term water safety
- A need to assess if this cost level is sustainable

---

### ✅ 7. Public Taps and Drilling Wells Are Also Major Cost Drivers
Additional spending highlights:
- **Public Taps: $9M**
- **Drill Wells: $8M**

These improvements directly support community access in rural and low-infrastructure areas.

---

### ✅ 8. Some Provinces Have Low Spending but High Needs
Provinces like **Amanzi** and **Hawassa** have noticeably lower costs despite population needs.  
This may indicate:
- Fewer improvement activities
- Delays in contractor execution
- Lower infrastructure capacity  
These areas may require further field review.

---

### ✅ 9. Total Improvements Completed: 25K
A total of **25,000 improvements** have been completed so far, showing strong operational activity despite budget challenges.

---

### 🧠 Summary
The dashboard highlights:
- **Strong progress in improving access**
- **High spending on water treatment technology**
- **Potential overspending risks**
- **Uneven budget distribution across provinces**
- **A need for closer monitoring of work pace**

These insights provide a clear picture of project health and help guide next steps for both public communication and internal decision-making.
